@Michael Leese Great game! It takes me back to my childhood hahaah.
- I found the controls a little slow to react, but I imagine that is more to do with it being a browser game, I am not sure how you could fix that.
- Towards the end of the first level when I was down to only 1 ship to hit, it suddenly started moving extremely fast! compared to how fast it was moving before, maybe that is part of the game though?
- I would have like a mute sounds button, I had to use the volume control on my laptop to turn the sound off as I was paying before everyone else was up in my home.
- I didn't look at the instructions before starting the game the first time, so had to figure out the controls on my own. Maybe flashing short controls instructions up on the screen before the game starts the first time might solve this?
- The game doesn't seem to be designed for mobiles? I couldn't get it to work on my phone with my finger, and everything was really tiny on the screen. You have not added the meta data in the <head> needed to scale it to mobile screens, was that deliberate? If the game is only for desktops it might be worth adding some kind of message to pop up when a user tries to access it from a mobile? You cold program it to pop up if the screen size goes under the break-point for desktop?
- You have an error in the console that might need looking at
- You have some inline styles in your html and hardly anything in your css file. This project is still marked on appropriate use of CSS (and HTML too), so might be worth moving those inline styles into your css file.
You didn't share your repo but I found it on github:
- For file naming your script directory should be named "js"
- I don't see any jasmine testing documents in your repo, adding at least a few tests would help your mark on testing. (edited)

@Michael Leese I had a quick look. I'm only on my first milestone, so these comments reflect zero understanding of the hard work you must have put in to the coding of the java. 1) I immediately clicked play and reached for the space bar and arrows - the conventional button for games like this, and they worked! Fab. I wonder if the other instructions could be summarised on a really simple screen just before you play so idiots like me who just click play and don't want to read the instructions are forced to - otherwise we won't enjoy the game as much? 2)
- I pressed space rapidly but bullets didn't fire that fast. Maybe my laptop? This was a little frustrating.
- The instructions were hard to read and the screen didn't seem to scroll left, right up or down. Maybe just me? I was in Safari. See Below.

Hi @Michael Leese I have never played a computer game (why am I doing this course) but hubbie was passing so I asked him. I got the dishwasher unloaded and a wash on before he gave me back the laptop :grin: So his comments.... when u go to help not obvious how to exit it (alien head)... restarting on level 2 is a nice feature... alien ships speed up too quick - more paced... he wanted some gaps between the buildings at the start so he needn't destroy to kill the aliens. That's his wish list - hope it helps :four_leaf_clover:
