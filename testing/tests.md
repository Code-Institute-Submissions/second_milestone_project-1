Testing was performed using Manual Testing of all functionality and some basic Jasmine Tests were performed on some non-Phaser API reliant Functions which were
adapted to remove setText functions inorder to prove they worked.
Tests were performedboth using the keyboard whilst touch not selected and with the mouse/touchscreen while touch was enabled.
