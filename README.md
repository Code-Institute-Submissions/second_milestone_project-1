# GALACTIC GUNNERS #

###### Second Milestone Project - Interactive Frontend Development ######

This is my Space Invaders Style Game that I created for all ages. The game consists of a Main Menu with Info Page, 3 Levels, Pause Screen and Victory and Titles Page.
The game is responsive and incorporates a selector for those that are playing on touch screen devices, although the game is primarily to be played for best results on the Desktop or Laptop, which is mentioned on the Main Menu Screen.


## Demo ##

A deployed version of the game can be played [here](https://michael-leese.github.io/second_milestone_project/).
